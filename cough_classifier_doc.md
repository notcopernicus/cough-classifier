# Cough Classifier: Machine Learning for Respiratory Diagnosis

## Overview

Developing a machine learning model to classify respiratory conditions through cough audio analysis. Essentially creating an acoustic diagnostic tool using consumer-grade hardware.

## Problem Statement

Respiratory diseases (COVID-19, tuberculosis, asthma, COPD, pneumonia) affect millions globally. Current diagnostic methods have significant limitations:

- Require expensive imaging or laboratory tests
- Depend on specialist availability and clinical expertise
- Present accessibility barriers in underserved regions
- Introduce delays in early intervention

Cough acoustics contain distinct signatures correlated with underlying pathology. An automated classifier could enable:
- Preliminary screening and triage
- Remote patient monitoring
- Epidemiological surveillance
- Expanded access in resource-limited settings

## Rationale for ML-Based Approach

### Clinical Foundation

Different respiratory pathologies produce characteristic cough patterns distinguishable by:
- Temporal structure (duration, frequency)
- Spectral content (pitch, harmonics)
- Production mechanism (dry vs. productive)

### Technical Feasibility

Smartphone ubiquity enables non-invasive data collection at scale. Modern deep learning architectures excel at audio pattern recognition, making deployment viable without specialized equipment.

### Potential Applications

- Pre-clinical screening tools
- Longitudinal disease monitoring
- Public health surveillance systems
- Telemedicine integration

## Methodology Overview

### Data Pipeline

**Preprocessing:**
- Audio segmentation and normalization
- Noise reduction and filtering
- Feature extraction (spectrograms, MFCCs, temporal features)

**Model Architecture:**
- Convolutional neural networks for spatial feature learning
- Recurrent architectures for temporal dependencies
- Transfer learning from pre-trained audio models (YAMNet, VGGish)

**Training Strategy:**
- Supervised learning with labeled clinical data
- Data augmentation (time stretching, pitch shifting)
- Cross-validation for generalization testing

### Classification Framework

Target categories:
- Baseline/healthy
- COVID-19
- Tuberculosis
- Asthma/COPD
- Bacterial pneumonia
- Pertussis

### Technical Challenges

**Data Considerations:**
- Class imbalance in disease prevalence
- Demographic variability in acoustic features
- Environmental noise interference
- Limited labeled datasets

**Validation Requirements:**
- Clinical gold-standard comparison
- Sensitivity/specificity analysis
- Subgroup performance evaluation
- External validation cohorts

**Ethical and Regulatory:**
- HIPAA compliance and data security
- Informed consent protocols
- Potential FDA classification as medical device
- Transparency in decision-making (explainable AI)
